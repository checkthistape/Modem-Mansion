# Modem-Mansion-visage

http://modem-mansion.ddns.net

Modem Mansion is another try to recreate that nostalgic web design charm of the 1990s.
Our project offers 90s web forum features and user interaction tools, serving as a digital sanctuary for web enthusiasts. Our purpose is to protest against the boringness of modern web design, continuing and supporting the Web Revival Movement and [Melon's](https://melonking.net/thoughts/manifesto) manifesto, which has been a big inspiration for this project.
Focused on community engagement, Modem Mansion provides an immersive environment for users to connect, share, and explore the charm of the early internet web world together.
